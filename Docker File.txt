We have 2 types of builds
 >Application Build
 >Image Build
>>Application Build: Developing, Compailing , Building an application File (i.e building a .jar or .war file)
  >>For Building Java file (like spring boot application) we use Maven/Gradle/Ant

>>Image Build:Building that .jar or .war to image by using Docker

Building Custom Images with Docker & Docker File
>Docker filr reference : https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/
Dockerfile: 
  Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.
  A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the 
  command line to assemble an image.

Here is the format of the Dockerfile: INSTRUCTION arguments
Most used instructions are as follows
>FROM : The FROM instruction initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image 
 for subsequent instructions. As such, a valid Dockerfile must start with a FROM instruction. 
 The image can be any valid image.
 Ex: FROM nginx:latest
 
>LABEL: The LABEL instruction adds metadata to an image. A LABEL is a key-value pair. 
 LABEL <key>=<value> <key>=<value> <key>=<value> ...
>RUN
>COPY
>ADD
>ENV
>ARG 
>EXPOSE 
>CMD 
>ENTRYPOINT 
>USER 
>WORKDIR
