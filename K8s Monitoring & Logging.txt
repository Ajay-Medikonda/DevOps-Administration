>> Prometheus 
   >> Prometheus is a leading open-source monitoring solution to capture metrics and configure 
      alerts for kubernetes.
      >> Prometheus servers (Retrieval, TSDB ---> Disk(HDD/SDD), HTTP server)
       >Retrieval
       >TSDB
       >HTTP Server
      >> Pushgateway (to support short-lived jobs)
      >> Exporters 
      >> Alertmanager
      >> Prometheus web UI (PromQL)
      >> Service Discovery
      >> Prometheus Targets

>> Deploying Prometheus
   >> We have to create namespace
   >> We have to create RBAC
   >> We have to create configmap
